# Notes

Coding notes, memos.

The underlying code is planned to be written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

I plan to use [North Sea Kraken](https://openkraken.com) for mobile development.

The desktop side is planned to be developed by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

Of course, everything is still an idea.
