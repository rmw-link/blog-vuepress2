# vuepress build blog

I have built a static blog based on vuep [ress 2.0](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org) as the official website of rmw.link.

The codebase address is [github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2)

The custom content is as follows :

* Use [md-padding](https://github.com/harttle/md-padding) and [git hooks](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/.direnv/git/hooks/pre-commit) to [automatically add spaces between Chinese and English](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/ce966b52f0a06bf2748af36f539f50eadc9eea3c/script/hook.coffee#L46)
  
  `git clone` After that, go to the directory and type `direnv allow`and [.envrc](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/.envrc) will be executed to install git hooks automatically.
  
  [direnv](https://direnv.net) is the environment autoloader tool. [Click here to see the tutorial](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1615495).
  
* [Automatically translate blogs to multiple languages](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/script/translate.coffee)
  
  See [markdown translation tools](/log/2021-12-09-markdown-translate)
  
* [Automatically clean up old files from other languages after renaming the main language file name](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/script/cleanup.coffee)
  
* [Translate theme configuration scripts](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/script/i18n.coffee)
  
* [Monitor changes and compile stylus styles and coffeescript scripts to](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/dev.sh) [`site/.vuepress`](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/dev.sh)
  
  Here we use the widget [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run multiple command line tasks concurrently, the parameter `--kill-others` ensures that only one script is running at a time
  
* [Modify Chinese fonts to](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/tree/master/styl) [`Noto Sans SC`](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/tree/master/styl)
  
* [Batch download script for fonts in css files](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/styl/font/download.xsh)
  
  Based on [xonsh](https://xon.sh), `./download.xsh code.css` will download fonts from css files and generate the corresponding stylus.
  
  xonsh is a useful combination of python and bash.
  
* [The default language of the browser is automatically switched when visiting the home page](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/coffee/clientAppEnhance.coffee)
  
* [Scan directories are automatically mapped to URLs](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/coffee/file_url.coffee)
  
* [sitemap.xml generation](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/master/script/sitemap.coffee)
  
* [Beautify the citation style](https://github.com/rmw-link/blog-vuepress2/blob/cbca993f56327dc4a55afc7a33690c80903f3774/styl/index.styl#L17)
  
  The citation style demo is as follows
  
  [Yifeng Ruan: "Why I like The Pirate Bay?](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2009/11/why_i_love_piratebay.html):
  
  > Some might say that without copyright, people would not be motivated to innovate.  
  > The success of the free software movement is proof that this argument is not true.  
  > In fact, free sharing can make great work, and it can also make money from its services.  
  > "Richard Stallman, the 'father of free software', said: **'I will never spend my life building a prison to imprison others!**  
  > So, please don't say "copyright system encourages originality" anymore, it's just a smokescreen for capitalists and a desecration of human creativity.  
  > Truly great inventions are made out of hobby or for noble purposes like "promoting human welfare", not for money!
