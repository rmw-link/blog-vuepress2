# mdi : embed code in markdown / version number / markdown ...

## Preface

Embedding version numbers and demo code in `readme.md` is a very common requirement.

There are some similar tools on the market, but none of them works well. So I wrote one myself ( executable size 256 KB ).

The function is to write a statement like `> ./demo.js` in markdown to embed the code, and the screenshot of the generated content is as follows :

In addition, with the [markdown translation tool](https://rmw.link/log/2021-12-09-markdown-translate) I wrote [based on deepl](https://rmw.link/log/2021-12-09-markdown-translate), you can automatically translate and render Chinese and English in the same `readme.md` file.

Then set an in-text anchor point (as below) at the top of the github readme, and click it to jump to the various language versions of the instructions, which will be a good user experience.

## Installation

[Download from github](https://github.com/rmw-lib/mdi/releases) or `cargo install mdi`

[Codebase address](https://github.com/rmw-lib/mdi)

## Use

`mdi [dir]`

It will search the directory `xxx.mdi.md` and replace `> ./xxx.rs` with the embedded code content, and then output to `xxx.md`.

If the embed is a markdown file, it will recursively render the references in it.
